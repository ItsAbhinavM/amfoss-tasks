# OVERVIEW
This project personally took me a lot of time, but I managed to complete it within 3-4 days. I also faced some issues regarding making the project public, as when I sent the project, it showed a "forbidden error" message. Now, I have solved the issue and tried it again, and now it's working. On top of all these challenges, I found this task to be entertaining and learned a lot about Arduino, which I also enjoyed.
