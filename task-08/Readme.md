# Overview
I haven't fully completed this task yet but stil i have completed this task about the search button in which it will take the datas of the pokemon from the poke-api and prints its datas and a picture of it , this was eventually a challenging task but due to much greater availability of the resources from certain webisites such as stack overflow , github and youtube , I was able to complete it to a certain limit
