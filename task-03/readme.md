# Summary
This was the task which took me a lot of days (even weeks) to solve it completely  as learning a new programming language is not a peace of cake .First I tried solving the problem using python as i am mor familiar with that language , then going on with the task I had google alot of stuufs inorder to learn some basic keywords or even the algorithms to solve those problems .At first in my onam vacation my strategy to finish this task was to learn those probramming languages at basic levels and then implemented my knowledge in the quesiton and then sove the question with the help of Google . Later when I reached back at college I came to know that wer dont need to completly learn those languages but just study the knowledge and algorithms fo how to approach theose problems .Which indeed took a lot of time and made way far back from my classmates who were also performing these praveshan quesitons . Still I found time and finished it (took me more than 3 weeks ) at the end which made me much releaved .
